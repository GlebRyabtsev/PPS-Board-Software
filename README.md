# Programmable Power Supply Board Software

This is the firmware for the ATMEGA328P microcontroller on my [programmable lab power supply board](https://github.com/GlebRyabtsev/PPS-Board).

The firmware communicates with the control interface over USB and supports several operating modes including guided calibration.
